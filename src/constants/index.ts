const personalDescription = `
        As a seasoned Fullstack Engineer based in Cairo, I bring extensive
        experience in leading frontend and backend development projects,
        prioritizing user-centric design and seamless integration. Throughout my
        journey at SideUp, advancing from Frontend Engineer to Senior Frontend
        Engineer, I've demonstrated leadership by mentoring peers, conducting
        thorough code reviews, and driving projects to success. Notably, my
        pivotal role in developing a B2C shipping dashboard underscored my
        proficiency in React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap, aligning closely with
        user needs and market trends. My passion for software development shines
        through my proactive pursuit of new technologies, evidenced by my
        completion of various courses and certifications. I excel in quickly
        learning and adapting to new environments, ensuring I remain at the
        forefront of innovation and deliver excellence in every project.`;
